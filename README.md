# Blackscreen
Blacks out the screen on primary Windows 11 displays and allows apps to float on top

This app blacks out the primary screen of a Windows PC and allows other apps to flopat on top.
I created this for showcasing apps, etc.
The Windows Taskbar will be covered over but can be restored by hitten the 'ESC' key to exit the app.
If the the Taskbar doesn't come back, restart the blackscreeen app and hit 'ESC'.
