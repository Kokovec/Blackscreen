# Blackscreen
Blacks out the screen on primary Windows 11 displays and allows apps to float on top

This app blacks out the primary screen of a Windows PC when it is expanded to fullscreen, and allows other apps to float on top.
I created this for showcasing apps, etc.
The Windows Taskbar will be covered over but can be restored by selecting the blackscreen app and hitting the 'ESC' key to exit the app.
If the the Taskbar doesn't come back, restart the blackscreeen app and hit 'ESC'.
Closing the app but closing the Terminal window will not restore the Taskbar.
